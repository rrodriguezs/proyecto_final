<h1>BIOGRAFÍA</h1>

<p>CNCO is one of the most-feted new groups in music history. Christopher (Ecuador), Erick Brian (Cuba), 
Joel (Mexico), Richard (Dominican Republic) and Zabdiel (Puerto Rico) are the members of CNCO; they're 
talented singers and dancers who range in age from 16 to 21. The group emerged from Univisión's musical 
competition, La Banda, which was executive-produced by Simon Cowell's SYCO Entertainment, the global icon 
Ricky Martin, Univisión Communications Inc., and Haim Saban's Saban Brands.Since then their journey has been 
incredible. They were the biggest winners at Univisión's 2016 Premios Juventud (Youth Awards), taking home 
five accolades: Catchiest Tune ("Tan Fácil"); Producer's Choice Award; My Pop/Rock Artist; My Favorite Twitter Celebrity; and That Man Has Style. Likewise, at the 2016 Latin American Music Awards, they won New Artist of the Year; Favorite New Artist – Pop/Rock; and Favorite Duo or Group.
This year the band also won, 3 awards in Premio Lo Nuestro, “Pop/Rock Album of the Year”, Pop/Rock Song of the 
Year”, Pop/Rock Duo of the Year”. They also took home an award in the ‘Best New Latin Artist of The Year’ category of the iHeart awards that took place on March 5th in LA. In addition to that, in the upcoming Billboard Latin Music Awards, scheduled for April 27, CNCO is a finalist in four categories: Artist of the Year, New; Latin Pop Artist of the Year, Duo or Group; Latin Pop Albums, Album of the Year (Primera Cita); Latin Pop Albums Artist of the Year, Duo or Group. This March the group kicked off their first headline tour, the Mas Alla Tour, visiting over 40 cities in 14 countries in Central and Latin America with one sold out show after another. In June, when the first leg of their tour comes to end, they will go on tour with Enrique Iglesias and Pitbull visiting all key cities in the US.
Thanks to the support of their millions of followers, known as CNCOwners, this group has dominated the music 
industry's most prestigious award ceremonies and will headline at top-tier live venues in the United States, 
Latin America and Europe this year.</p>    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
<h2>CHRISTOPHER </h2>

<p>This 21-year-old Ecuadorean moved to New Jersey in search of a better life for his family. 
He shined shoes for a time, until he decided to follow his dreams and audition for La Banda. 
Being far from his family motivated him to stand out week after week as one of the favorites on the show, 
and become a member of CNCO. Now, I am able to help my family in what they need, but most importantly I am able to do what I love which 
is my music.</p>



<h2>ERICK BRIAN</h2>

<p>He arrived in the U.S. with his mother and sister from Cuba just a few years ago. He loves to play football, 
dance, and participate in musical activities at his school in Tampa. With only 16 years of age, Erick stole the
hearts of the voters and the judges in La Banda, who saw in him a very unique talent. His motivation has been 
his family, many of whom still live in Cuba.

Now I can transmit the feelings I have inside and show what I love to do when I’m on stage. Even though I am 
far from my family, they are happy and support me 100%. </p>

<h2>JOEL</h2>
<p>The biggest inspiration for this 18-year-old Californian of Mexican ancestry has been his late grandfather, 
who gave him the strength to continue singing and to study theater. Even though at one point he thought he 
was going home during the contest, his tenacity, hard-work, and talent ultimately made him one of the members of CNCO.
My grandfather inspires me because he showed me the love for music. Ed Sheeran inspires me because he writes and
sings from the deepest part of his soul.</p>


<h2>JRICHARD</h2>
<p>He grew up in the entertainment world, with a musician and cameraman as a father and a dancer for a mother. 
This 20-year-old Dominican likes to dance and write songs, and share his love of music with his twin brother. 
Since he was 3-years-old, Richard knew that music ran through his veins. It was evident to the voters, as well
as the judges, who supported him in making his dream come true and becoming a member of CNCO.My life has 
completely changed. It changed in a very crazy but positive way. I am living my dream and that of my family.</p>


<h2>ZABDIEL</h2>
<p>This 19-year-old Puerto Rican knew he wanted to be a singer since he was 12-years-old and was part of a hip-hop
and salsa group in his church. He is a musician, singer,and ballet dancer. His passion for music was clearly 
visible each night that Zabdiel performed in La Banda. He left his soul on stage and won over the audience that
made him a member of CNCO. La Banda was the opportunity to present myself to thousands of people, and with this
help my family move ahead. I am blessed to work hard in what motivates me the most, music.</p>
